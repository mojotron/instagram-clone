You can create a profile or look around with a pre made test account.

## Assignment

Replicate your favorite website as close as possible - Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Just make sure it has lots of interesting functionality. You’ll be integrating a full array of skills into this one. If you have completed a backend course, you may use that for this project, otherwise use Firebase. This should prove that you now have all the tools and knowledge needed to build a website, just like the ones you use every day.

## Goal of the project

I decided to replicate instagram, because it looked as the biggest challenge to take. My goal was to replicate all the core features involving images. Features with videos are not included because this is a learning project and free Firebase plan has only 5GB storage. All features of marketing or commercial nature are skipped.
